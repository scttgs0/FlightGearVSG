/**
 * @brief Class holding a source string and its translation in a language
 *
 * This class is a container for a source text and its translation in the
 * language corresponding to the currently selected locale, including plural
 * forms if any. The source text is a string in “engineering English”, known
 * as a “master string” or “default translation”.
 *
 * When the translation may depend on an integer (a number of “items” of any
 * kind), instances of this class will have `_hasPlural = true` and
 * their @c _sourceText member should use an indeterminate form such as “Found
 * %1 file(s)”. Corresponding plural forms in proper English locales (as
 * opposed to “engineering English”) will then be “Found %1 file” and “Found
 * %1 files”; they will be chosen according to the number passed to
 * FGTranslate::setCardinalNumber().
