/**
 * @brief Class for retrieving translated strings
 *
 * The defaut domain is “core”; it corresponds to translations defined in
 * FGData. Other domains are “current-aircraft” and “addons/⟨addonId⟩”.
 *
 * If the translatable string specified by the (domain, resource, basicId,
 * index) tuple doesn't have has-plural="true" in the default translation,
 * it is a string with no plural forms. Member functions get() and
 * getWithDefault() are appropriate for retrieving translations of such
 * strings. On the other hand, if a translatable string is defined with
 * has-plural="true" in the default translation, it has plural forms.
 * Member functions getPlural() and getPluralWithDefault() are suitable for
 * such strings: they require an additional parmeter (“cardinal number”)
 * which is necessary to choose the correct plural form.
 *
 * If your code doesn't know in advance whether the string has plural
 * forms, use translationUnit(). With the result, you can query whether the
 * string has plural forms and obtain a translation (see the overloads of
 * TranslationUnit::getTranslation(): one accepts a cardinal number, the
 * other one doesn't). Doing so minimizes the number of lookups for the
 * resource, basicId and index because a @c TranslationUnit object contains
 * all the information pertaining to a given translatable string.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * Retrieve the translation of a string defined in FGData that has no
 * plural forms (domain = "core", resource = "options", basicId = "usage",
 * index = 0):
 * @code
 * std::string t = FGTranslate().get("options", "usage");
 * @endcode
 *
 * or equivalently:
 * @code
 * std::string t = FGTranslate("core").get("options", "usage");
 * @endcode
 *
 * Similar thing but using the second string (index 1) having the id
 * "fg-scenery-desc":
 * @code
 * std::string t = FGTranslate().get("options", "fg-scenery-desc", 1);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Similar thing, but fetching the translation from the Skeleton add-on:
 * @code
 * std::string t =
 *   FGTranslate("addons/org.flightgear.addons.Skeleton").get(
 *     "some-resource", "some-id", 1);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Retrieve a translation with plural forms defined in the current
 * aircraft. Let's assume the translation depends on a number of
 * liveries present in the @a nbLiveries variable.
 * @code
 * std::string t = FGTranslate("current-aircraft").getPlural(
 *                   nbLiveries, "some-resource", "some-id");
 * @endcode
